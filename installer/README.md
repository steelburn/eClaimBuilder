## Running the installer

The installer script simplifies your process of getting the rest of the package and building what's necessary. 
What you need to do is just prepare a clean Debian 10.x installation, and run the following command in CLI terminal:

`` curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steelburn/eClaimBuilder/master/installer/installer.sh | bash ``

Alternatively, you may use the following command if you don't have ``curl`` package:

``wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steelburn/eClaimBuilder/master/installer/installer.sh && bash installer.sh``
